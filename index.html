        <p id="first"><strong>Hello</strong>, and welcome to my first website. My name is Laura, and I am a 33-year-old communication master's student trying to excel in both school and my job, while also balancing time with family and friends. I work full-time at George Mason University as an Assistant Director of Marketing and Communication for the College of Science where I <a href="portfolio.htm#writing">write</a> about faculty, students, and alumni, while also promoting everything the college has to offer to the next genereation of scientists. </p>
       
        <p>I have a black belt in documentary watching and can carry a conversation about all things Tudor with the best of them. If you challenge me to a sing-off to Broadway's Hamilton, <strong>prepare to lose.</strong> </p>
